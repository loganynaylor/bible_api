      "book_name": "John",
      "chapter": 3,
      "verse": 16,
      "text": "\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\n\n"
    }
  ],
  "text": "\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\n\n",

## Hosting it Yourself

If you want to host this application yourself, you'll need a Linux server with Ruby and MySQL (or MariaDB) installed. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/seven1m/bible_api
   cd bible_api
   git submodule update --init
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   gem install bundler
   bundle config --local deployment true # optional, but prefered on a server
   bundle install
   ```

3. Create the database and import the translations:

   ```
   mysql -uroot -e "create database bible_api; grant all on bible_api.* to user@localhost identified by 'password';"
   export BIBLE_API_DB="mysql2://user:password@localhost/bible_api"
   bundle exec ruby import.rb
   ```

4. Host the app with [Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/advanced_guides/install_and_upgrade/standalone/install/)

   ... or run `bundle exec ruby app.rb` if you are just testing.
